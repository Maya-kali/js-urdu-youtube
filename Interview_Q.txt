JavaScript ExecutionContext
JS run Two-way execution
codefiles.js Global ExecutionContext (this value in browser window object) important 

- Global ExecutionContext
- Function ExecutionContext
- in mongos and Eval ExecutionContext

[code] = Memory creation phase = Allocate memory 
[code] = Execution Phase = run variable multiplication, etc.

let val1 = 4;
let val2 = 5;

function addNum(num1, num2) {
    let total = num1 + num2;
    return total
}
let result = addNum(num1, num2);
let result2 = addNum(10, 2)



1 - Global ExecutionContext = Allocate in this
2 - Memory creation phase is called first cycle. = collect all variable multiplication
    a - val1 = undefined
    b - val2 = undefined
    c - addNum = Definition 
 
    (num1, num2) {
    let total = num1 + num2;
    return total
}
    d - result = undefined
    e - result2 = undefined


3 - Execution Phase
    a - val1 = 4;
    b - val2 = 5;
    c - addNum [new variable environment + execution thread] and it will delete.
    c1 - result = 9
    c2 - result2 = 12

    d - Memory creation phase
        val1 = undefined
        val2 = undefined
        total = undefined

    e - Execution phase
        num1 = 4;
        num2 = 5;
        total = 9
